    - title: Rules

      description: >
        Along with the rules below, members are expected to follow:
        
        the [MQD Safer Spaces Policy](https://bit.ly/MQD-SSP)
        
        and [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). 


- type: rules

  rules:
    No bigotry: >
      Do not engage in racism, sexism, ableism, queerphobia, homophobia, lesbophobia, biphobia, transphobia, acephobia, arophobia, fatphobia, plural/sysphobia, nor engage in classist, anti-sexwork, or anti-refugee rhetoric.

    Respect other users' boundaries: >
      This includes obtaining consent before sending DMs, or ‚Äòacting out‚Äô interactions such as with second person pronouns or [*action*]s.
      
      Do not overstep boundaries by asking overly personal or invasive questions.

    Content on this server is confidential: >
      Do not record or capture any activity from this server, or discuss its content with non-members.
      
      Be mindful of the risk of outing other server members.

    Do not engage in drama/gossip about other students: >
      Any legitimate grievances should be raised privately with a Queer Officer or QUAC Member.
      
      Active rule violations should be raised using the <@&1058964816355655690> ping.

    Respect others‚Äô identity, experiences, and beliefs: >
      This includes respecting the ways other members wish to be referred to, e.g. pronouns, names, and identifying language.

    Be mindful of your privilege: >
      Be aware of the privilege you may have and be wary of speaking over or on behalf of marginalised groups.
      
      Be aware of the potential harm of appropriating certain language away from its culture.

    Avoid ableist language: >
      Words like ||stupid, lame, smart, and dumb|| reinforce ableist ideas and provide legitimacy to ableist psychology such as IQ and MBTI.

    Use content warnings: >
      Content warnings, or CWs, are notices before a message or image to disclose parts of the content that others may want to avoid for their own comfort. 
      
      
      You should provide these (including retroactively) when requested or appropriate. 
      
      User-requested CWs are found in <#867610333137076234>.
       
      **Discord Spoilers**
      
      The content itself should be enclosed in a `||spoiler||`, hiding it until a user clicks. 
      
      Most ways to spoiler text and images are detailed [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632). 
      
      On some devices, images need to be renamed to start with `SPOILER_` instead.

    Keep content accessible: >
      When posting images, please provide an [image description](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-an-image-description-2f30d3bf5546).

    Do not misuse/disrespect accessibility tools: >
      [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) is here as aid for self-identification purposes.
      
      This can be used by (e.g.) [plural systems](https://morethanone.info/) to identify who sent a message. 
      
      These messages will include `[BOT]` - but are sent by real server members.
      
      React ‚ùì to find out more about a PluralKit message, or ‚ùó to ping the member sent it.
      
      When using PluralKit, please set a system tag on this server.
