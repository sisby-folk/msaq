    - title: Rules for this space

      description: >
        Along with these rules, server members are required follow the [MQD Safer Spaces Policy](https://bit.ly/MQD-SSP)
        
        Additionally, members must abide by [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). 
        
        After reading, please set your pronouns and server nickname to reflect how you'd like to be referred to.

- type: rules

  rules:
    No bigotry: >
      We will not accept racism, sexism, ableism, queerphobia, homophobia, lesbophobia, biphobia, transphobia, acephobia, arophobia, fatphobia, plural/sysphobia or engaging in classist, anti-sexwork, or anti-refugee rhetoric.

    Respect other users' boundaries: >
      This includes obtaining consent before sending DMs, or ‘acting out’ interactions such as with second person pronouns or [*action*]s.
      
      Do not overstep boundaries by asking overly personal or invasive questions.

    Content on this server is confidential: >
      Do not record or capture any activity from this server, or discuss its content with non-members.
      
      Be mindful of the risk of outing other server members.

    Do not engage in drama/gossip about other students: >
      Any legitimate grievances should be raised privately with a Queer Officer or committee member.
      
      Active rule violations should be raised using the @moderator ping.

    Respect others’ identity, experiences, and beliefs: >
      This includes respecting the ways other members wish to be referred to, including pronouns, names, and identifying language.

    Be mindful of your privilege: >
      Be aware of the privilege you may have and be wary of speaking over or on behalf of marginalised groups.

    Avoid appropriative and ableist language: >
      Usage of certain words and phrases can be innately harmful due to having ableist connotations, or by being appropriated away from their culture by the speaker.

    Use content warnings: >
      Content warnings, or CWs, are notices before a message or image to disclose parts of the content that others may want to avoid for their own comfort. 
      
      You should provide these (including retroactively) when requested or appropriate. 
      
      The content itself should be enclosed in a “spoiler”, hiding it until a user clicks. 
      
      User-requested CWs are found in <#867610333137076234>.
       
      **Discord Spoilers**
      
      Most ways to spoiler text and images are detailed [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632). 
      
      On some devices, images need to be renamed to start with `SPOILER_` instead.

    Keep content accessible: >
      When posting images, please provide an [image description](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-an-image-description-2f30d3bf5546).

    Do not misuse/disrespect accessibility tools: >
      [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) is here as aid for self-identification purposes. Role-playing is not allowed.
      
      For example, this can be used by [plural systems](https://morethanone.info/) to identify who sent a message. 
      
      Due to Discord limitations, these messages will display `[BOT]` - don’t worry, these are real members.
      
      React ❓ to find out more about a PluralKit message, or ❗ to ping who sent it.
      
      Please set a system tag using `pk;s tag` when using PluralKit here.
