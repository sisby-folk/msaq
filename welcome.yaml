    - title: Rules

      description: >
        Along with the rules below, members are expected to follow:
        
        the [MQD Safer Spaces Policy](https://bit.ly/MQD-SSP)
        
        and [Discord's Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). 
        
        After reading, please set your pronouns and server nickname to reflect how you'd like to be referred to.

- type: rules

  rules:
    No bigotry: >
      Do not engage in racism, sexism, ableism, queerphobia, homophobia, lesbophobia, biphobia, transphobia, acephobia, arophobia, fatphobia, plural/sysphobia, nor engage in classist, anti-sexwork, or anti-refugee rhetoric.

    Respect other users' boundaries: >
      This includes obtaining consent before sending DMs, or ‘acting out’ interactions such as with second person pronouns or [*action*]s.
      
      Do not overstep boundaries by asking overly personal or invasive questions.

    Content on this server is confidential: >
      Do not record or capture any activity from this server, or discuss its content with non-members.
      
      Be mindful of the risk of outing other server members.

    Do not engage in drama/gossip about other students: >
      Any legitimate grievances should be raised privately with a Queer Officer or committee member.
      
      Active rule violations should be raised using the <@&1058964816355655690> ping.

    Respect others’ identity, experiences, and beliefs: >
      This includes respecting the ways other members wish to be referred to, including pronouns, names, and identifying language.

    Be mindful of your privilege: >
      Be aware of the privilege you may have and be wary of speaking over or on behalf of marginalised groups.

    Avoid appropriative and ableist language: >
      Usage of certain words and phrases can be innately harmful due to having ableist connotations, or by being appropriated away from their culture by the speaker.

    Use content warnings: >
      Content warnings, or CWs, are notices before a message or image to disclose parts of the content that others may want to avoid for their own comfort. 
      
      
      You should provide these (including retroactively) when requested or appropriate. 
      
      User-requested CWs are found in <#867610333137076234>.
       
      **Discord Spoilers**
      
      The content itself should be enclosed in a `||spoiler||`, hiding it until a user clicks. 
      
      Most ways to spoiler text and images are detailed [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632). 
      
      On some devices, images need to be renamed to start with `SPOILER_` instead.

    Keep content accessible: >
      When posting images, please provide an [image description](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-an-image-description-2f30d3bf5546).

    Do not misuse/disrespect accessibility tools: >
      [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) is here as aid for self-identification purposes.
      
      This can be used by (e.g.) [plural systems](https://morethanone.info/) to identify who sent a message. 
      
      These messages will include `[BOT]` - but are sent by real server members.
      
      React ❓ to find out more about a PluralKit message, or ❗ to ping the member sent it.
      
      When using PluralKit, please set a system tag on this server.
